Armstrong number


Program Explanation:

1} User must enter the number and store it in a variable.
2} The map function obtains each digit from the number and converts it to a string and stores it in a list.
3} The second map function cubes each digit and stores it in another list.
4} Then the sum of the cubes of the digits is found and is checked if it is equal to the original number.
5} If the sum of the cube of digits is equal to the original number, the number is an Armstrong number.
6} The final result is printed.
